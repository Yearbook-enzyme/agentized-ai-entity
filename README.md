# agentized-ai-entity
compilation of many ai interaction/thought frameworks and github repositories to be used together in some way as a single entity made of smaller entities similar to the [thousand brains theory](https://www.numenta.com/technology/research/thousand-brains-theory/)
the present goal is for it to just be an enhanced chatbot that can do many things since it will be quite tedious to figure out how to make all of the repositories interact

## my setup
i am running a ubuntu virtual machine on my computer because open interpreter should allow it to fully interact with the computer if i can make it work the way i want it to and i dont know to what extent erronious things may pile up.
i still dont know yet if this is fully possible to do the way i think but i want it to be possible, i know almost nothing about coding so chatgpt basically does all of that for me.
i seem to be needing 5 openai api keys and 1 bing api key if i were to use bshr, crewai, memgpt, open interpreter, remo, bing search.

## current happenings
check the [discussions](https://github.com/Yearbook-enzyme/agentized-ai-entity/discussions) section to interact with others

## current to do
- try testing things!
- get people looking at this github repository! make sure to share it around to those who might be interested.
- i need people to help muddle through integration hell with me to get this all to work together cohesively because i know very little about coding and so far that is entirely a job being done by chatgpt.
- figure out a solution to starting this all up and getting them all to interact and seeing results of what the agentized ai entity does as well as a way to provide feedback to it simply (if possible step by step)

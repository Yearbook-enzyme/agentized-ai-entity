# agentized-ai-entity
compilation of many ai interaction/thought frameworks and github repositories to be used together in some way as a entity made of smaller entities similar to the [thousand brains theory](https://www.numenta.com/technology/research/thousand-brains-theory/)


## my setup
i am running an ubuntu virtual machine on my computer because open interpreter should allow it to fully interact with the computer if i can make it work the way i want it to and i dont know to what extent erronous things may pile up.
i still dont know yet if this is fully possible to do the way i think but i want it to be possible, i know almost nothing about coding so chatgpt basically does all of that for me.

## current to do
- organize the list of links below more clearly (the broad to niche order may possibly be incorrect and should be reordered if needed) as a flowchart to be easily shown how all of the repositories should interact
- the exactness of what the entity should aim to be is still being decided but so far the idea is to just be a enhanced chatbot that can do many things
- gather people to make this project work if i run into problems
